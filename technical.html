									<p>During my journey, I was confronted with problem situations (technical problem solving, strategic choices ...) 
										during which I had to implement a relevant practice to achieve a desired result.
										I describe such situations in this section. The chosen problem situations highlight 
										the technical knowledge I have developed in direct relation to the Training, and my way of solving problems based on this.
										Note that the problems are grouped by training units.

									<!--SMART DEVICES-->
									<h3><u>Smart Devices</u></h3>
									<div class="row">
										
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h4>Presentation</h4>
											<p>When working on smart devices, it is important to be able to understand the sensing technology of the connected
												devices. This implies knowledge about sensors, actuators, microcontrollers and how to interface the 
												whole system. In this context, the microcontroller and open-source hardware module brought 
												competences and knowledge in this field.</p>

									<!--COMMUNICATION-->
									<h3><u>Communication</u></h3>
									<div class="row">
										
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h4>Presentation</h4>
											<p>The Communication module is really vast, as it covers some aspects from MAC layers and protocols, 
												to emerging networks and technologies with 5G. It also deals with the issue of energy for connected 
												objects and embedded systems. The main problem for me in this training unit was the workload and the fact 
												that it is not my field of expertise which implies that I needed more time to assimilate the concepts. The fact 
												that this unit of formation is divided into five sub-parts makes it it rich and interesting, but also makes its difficulty. 
											</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h4>Resolution</h4>
											<p>To overcome this problem, I had to work hard and particularly I had to read up on the topics discussed. 
												The mandatory research works helped me in understanding some important points. Hopefully, I already have
												some expertise in some of the covered topics, as Energy for Embedded Systems, because I already took this cours in 
												4th year. It also allowed me to concentrate on the subjects I mastered the least. 
											</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h4>Knowledge & skills</h4>
											<p>This training helped me improve my networking skills as well as my knowledge about communication technologies (3G, 4G, 5G, Zigbee, LoRa, Sigfox,...).
												I also reviewed my competences on signal modulation and telecommunications through the Software-defined radio lab.
												The Emerging Networks course allowed me to acquire knowledge and develop initial skills in configuring SDN equipment and 
												developing network control applications on an SDN infrastructure. Even if the course took place at the very end of the semester, 
												I could also learn the basic notions of security for IoT networks.
												</p>
										</div>
									</div>	
									<h4>Review</h4>
									<p>This training unit was very complete, and I learned a wide range of skills. This training unit was also very various in terms of learning methods: it was 
										composed of lectures, practical work and labs, research work and discussions. This is the training unit in which I have made the most progress due to the 
										plurality of the courses. </p>



									<!--MIDDLEWARE AND SERVICES-->
									<h3><u>Middleware and services</u></h3>
									<div class="row">
										
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h4>Presentation</h4>
											<p>This training unit is software-oriented and was thus very new to me. But the course format with online videos and labs 
												allowed me to keep pace. At first, I encountered some difficulties with the settings of Virtual Machines and dockers. I also struggled 
												at first on the OM2M part because I did not master the basics yet. </p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h4>Resolution</h4>
											<p>Thanks to peer exchange and the research work I made, I managed to set up correctly the VM network. For the OM2M part, I 
												managed to set up the sensor networks with some help and personnal work. 
											</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h4>Knowledge & skills</h4>
											<p>This module, through the resolution of the many software problems I encountered, allowed me to learn a lot about middlewares in general.
												I could deploy and configure and IoT architecture using OM2M, and interact with the different resources of the architecture using REST services.
												I learned how to address HTTP requests, and how to build a dashboard with NodeRed. It was a good way for me to refresh my memory of the Java coding.
												As I did not know much about IoT before, I also 
												learned how to situate the main standards for the Internet of Things.
											</p>
										</div>
									</div>	
									<h4>Review</h4>
									<p>Concerning learning methods, this training units was mainly based on MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses). I liked this format, 
										because it allowed me to work at my own rythm. I appreciated it more than lectures, because you can just pause the videos if you 
										need more time to take notes, and you can also replay. I also liked much the lab format of the Cloud and autonomic management course, 
										which allowed us to start with a strong theorical part and move on rapidly to practise. Finally, this training unit was a lot about IoT itslef
										and I consider it as central to the training. 
									</p>


									<!--DATA-->
									<h3><u>Data and application</u></h3>
									<div class="row">
										
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h4>Presentation</h4>
											<p>This formation unit was about semantic web, software engineering and big data analysis. These three components of course raise major 
												problems in terms of data accessibility and processing, and it is interesting to find out about them. The main problem I encountered 
												in this course is struggling with the use of Protégé and R softwares. </p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h4>Resolution</h4>
											<p>Once again, the peer exchange, teamwork and personal research enabled me to progress a lot in this training unit. I had a lot of self training 
												on RStudio in order to become efficient in processing data. I really liked the fact that I was able to quickly build up my skills, and working on 
												real datasets is extremely motivating. 
											</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h4>Knowledge & skills</h4>
											<p>I consider that I acquired brand new skills about software development and Agile/Scrum method, as well as data processing and analysis. I really appreciated
												the big data project, because the topic of study was free of choice. I was very captivated by the fact of formatting data sets. R is a very powerful tool for this, 
												although it takes a bit of practice to use it efficiently. </p>
										</div>
									</div>	
									<h4>Review</h4>
									<p>In my opinion, this training unit is going to be the most usefull for me as an engineer, based on my career plan. I am still not an expert in big data and 
										software development, but I plan to increase those skills during my last year internship. 
									</p>


									<!--INNOVATION-->
									<h3><u>Innovation</u></h3>
									<div class="row">
										
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h4>Presentation</h4>
											<p>The lessons covered are quite vast, and range from innovation techniques to team management as well as ethical and moral reflections. When it is expected 
												from an engineer to have a solid technical background, we often miss the importance of humanity classes in the curriculum. In my opinion, this training unit is 
												really well constructed and it helped me a lot in the management and realisation of the Innovative Project. The different modules were very complementary, 
												and helped me to do a good abstraction of the project. 
											</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h4>Resolution</h4>
											<p>It was very interesting to discuss the ethical issues linked with innovative projects. The way of resolution was discussion and 
												exchange about ethics and team management. I think it is very enriching to have the opportunity to discuss about such important topics
												in a course. It encourages peer exchange and personnal reflexion on the role of an engineer. The portfolio is also part of this unit, and 
												allowed me to take a step back from my training. This allows a very enriching work of reflection and introspection. I will give more details about the 
												portfolio itself in the <a href="review.html" target="_blank" >General Review</a> part. 
											</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h4>Knowledge & skills</h4>
											<p>As we talked about creativity and innovation, learning about the TRIZ method is for me an asset. I was impressed by the concept and its 
												strengths. Even if it can be quite heavy to apply to any situation, I think the concept itself says quite much about new ways of
												finding innovation. My view upon innovation is now different, and I see it now as a balance between what could be improved and the 
												nefast impact the improvement could have on the rest of the system. In terms of team management, I think that I will now pay more attention
												to the team cohesion and needs of each member. Through the creation of the portfolio, I learned from scratch HTML5 and CSS3.
											</p>
										</div>
									</div>	
									<h4>Review</h4>
									<p>This training unit is multidisciplinary, and in my opinion supports the whole ISS training. I find this teaching essential, 
										and I feel that I have learned a lot in terms of project management, responsibility and innovation techniques. Concerning the portfolio, 
										I am convinced that in learned a lot in the creation of the website itself, as well as filling in its content. 
									 </p>


									<!--INNOVATIVE PROJECT-->
									<h3><u>Innovative Project</u></h3>
									<div class="row">
										
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h4>Presentation</h4>
											<p>The innovative project is the main thread of the semester, which should enable us to apply the skills related to the ISS training courses. 
												It is a challenging and innovative project, to which the team of students must provide a real functional technical prototype. Communication 
												skills are also evaluated with a project report at the end of the semester. The project I was involved in is a flight simulator project 
												with VR helmet and dynamic seat for demonstration at INSA. I was in charge of developing the controllers and interfacing with the rest of the system. </p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h4>Resolution</h4>
											<p>We faced several problems in the realisation of the flight simulator. First, the project started quite late so in the end we only have three 
												month to imagine, develop and implement a functional system. The delay is quite short, compared to the workload expected in the project. 
												Also, we were dependent on delivery times which slowed the whole project by at least a week. A solution could be to give ISS students an 
												already existing and partly functional project, not to start from scratch. In my case, it was a bit frustrating not to apply my newly competences 
												instead of what I did a lot of mechanics and assembly. Maybe the projects should target better the competences that we develop in ISS. 
											</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h4>Knowledge & skills</h4>
											<p>Even though it was a bit frustrating not to finish our project as we would have liked to, I was happy of what I produced in the end. 
												I learned project management, as I was in charge of most of the organisation and communication. I also skilled up in 3D-printing process, 
												and assembly of a mechanical system. I think these new skills can be usefull in case I want to develop my own prototypes for personal projects in the future.
											</p>
										</div>
									</div>	
									<h4>Review</h4>
									<p>Another big asset is that the project workload could be easily divided between the team members, allowing each to work on the part they are more comfortable with. Multidisciplinary work takes on its full meaning, 
										and the plurality of backgrounds in the team is essential. Also, the tutors helped us at anytime and I am very thankfull for that. One big asset is having an assigned budget, 
										it allows to order the necessary parts according on what we planned, and work on a concrete development.
									</p>
