									<p>During my journey, I was confronted with problem situations (technical problem solving, strategic choices ...) 
										during which I had to implement a relevant practice to achieve a desired result.
										I describe such situations in this section. The chosen problem situations highlight 
										the technical knowledge I have developed in direct relation to the Training, and my way of solving problems based on this.
										Note that the problems are grouped by training units.

									<!--SMART DEVICES-->
									<h3><u>Smart Devices</u></h3>
									<div class="row">
										
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h4>Presentation</h4>
											<p>When working on smart devices, it is imoprtant to be able to understand the sensing technology of the connected
												devices. This implies knowledge about sensors, actuators, microcontrollers and how to interface the 
												whole system. In this context, the microcontroller and open-source hardware module brought 
												competences and knowledge in this field.</p>

									<!--COMMUNICATION-->
									<h3><u>Communication</u></h3>
									<div class="row">
										
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h4>Presentation</h4>
											<p>The Communication module is really vast, as it covers some aspects from MAC layers and protocols, 
												to emerging networks and technologies with 5G. It also deals with the issue of energy for connected 
												objects and embedded systems. The main problem for me in this training unit was the workload and the fact 
												that it is not my field of expertise which implies that I needed more time to assimilate the concepts. The fact 
												that this unit of formation is divided into five sub-parts makes it it rich and interesting, but also makes its difficulty. 
											</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h4>Resolution</h4>
											<p>To overcome this problem, I had to work hard and particularly I had to read up on the topics discussed. 
												The mandatory research works helped me in understanding some important points. Hopefully, I already have
												some expertise in some of the covered topics, as Energy for Embedded Systems, because I already took this cours in 
												4th year. It also allowed me to concentrate on the subjects I mastered the least. 
											</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h4>Knowledge & skills</h4>
											<p>This training helped me improve my networking skills as well as my knowledge about communication technologies (3G, 4G, 5G, Zigbee, LoRa, Sigfox,...).
												I also reviewed my competences on signal modulation and telecommunications through the Software-defined radio lab.
												The Emerging Networks course allowed me to acquire knowledge and develop initial skills in configuring SDN equipment and 
												developing network control applications on an SDN infrastructure. Even if the course took place at the very end of the semester, 
												I could also learn the basic notions of security for IoT networks.
												</p>
										</div>
									</div>	
									<h4>Review</h4>
									<p>This training unit was very complete, and I learned a wide range of skills. This training unit was also very various in terms of learning methods: it was 
										composed of lectures, practical work and labs, research work and discussions. This is the training unit in which I have made the most progress due to the 
										plurality of the courses. </p>



									<!--MIDDLEWARE AND SERVICES-->
									<h3><u>Middleware and services</u></h3>
									<div class="row">
										
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h4>Presentation</h4>
											<p>This training unit is software-oriented and was thus very new to me. But the course format with online videos and labs 
												allowed me to keep pace. At first, I encountered some difficulties with the settings of Virtual Machines and dockers. I also struggled 
												at first on the OM2M part because I did not master the basics yet. </p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h4>Resolution</h4>
											<p>Thanks to peer exchange and the research work I made, I managed to set up correctly the VM network. For the OM2M part, I 
												managed to set up the sensor networks with some help and personnal work. 
											</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h4>Knowledge & skills</h4>
											<p>This module, through the resolution of the many software problems I encountered, allowed me to learn a lot about middlewares in general.
												I could deploy and configure and IoT architecture using OM2M, and interact with the different resources of the architecture using REST services.
												I learned how to address HTTP requests, and how to build a dashboard with NodeRed. It was a good way for me to refresh my memory of the Java coding.
												As I did not know much about IoT before, I also 
												learned how to situate the main standards for the Internet of Things.
											</p>
										</div>
									</div>	
									<h4>Review</h4>
									<p>Concerning learning methods, this training units was mainly based on MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses). I liked this format, 
										because it allowed me to work at my own rythm. I appreciated it more than lectures, because you can just pause the videos if you 
										need more time to take notes, and you can also replay. I also liked much the lab format of the Cloud and autonomic management course, 
										which allowed us to start with a strong theorical part and move on rapidly to practise. Finally, this training unit was a lot about IoT itslef
										and I consider it as central to the training.
