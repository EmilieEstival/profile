										<h1>General Review</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/review2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										
									<p>This part intends to provide a general review of acquired skills and learning methods. In the previous sections, 
										I presented my experiences linked to the Innovative Smart Systems training, and also presented some problem situations 
										I faced and the way to solve them.
										This last part will be more focused on a synthesis of this year and a reflexion about 
										what it brought to me, what I think I mastered and could be important for my future engineer position.
									</p>
								
									<h2><u>ISS in 3 words</u></h2>
									<div class="row">
										
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h3>Innovation</h3>
											<p>Obviously at the heart of the training, innovation is an essential component around which the course modules are structured. 
												The very concept of innovation is vast, but the ISS speciality covers the major aspects of it, from theory to practice. 
												From a personal point of view, I now feel that I am able to justify why I am passionate about innovation and how I have 
												been able to develop my skills in this area. 
											</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h3>Teamwork</h3>
											<p>The ISS programme puts teamwork back at the heart of the training. Group work is an absolutely essential skill for an engineer, 
												and I am now able to justify diverse team experiences. Another very important component is knowing how to learn from others, 
												and trusting others to bring us expertise that we wouldn't have on our own. I am very pleased to 
												have been able to work with people from different backgrounds for my last year at INSA, and I have definitely learned trust the expertise of others. 
											</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<h3>Data</h3>
											<p>In my opinion, the ISS training revolves around data. 
												I learned how to recover data from the environment throug the use of sensors, 
												transform the gathered data in a comprehensible format, communicate to a remote device, 
												display the data in a user-friendly way and analyse it. I think it is essential to address the issue of data at all levels, 
												as trends show that the world will become increasingly connected. </p>
										</div>
									</div>			




									<h2><u>Learning Methods</u></h2>
									<div class="row">
											<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
												<h3>Project</h3>
												<p>
													A large part of the teaching is based on the innovative project, which is supposed to make us apply the concepts seen during 
													the year, and apply our knowledge in general. It is also an opportunity to work in a team with people from other backgrounds 
													who are experts in their field. Finally, it allows us to gain experience in project and budget management.
												</p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
												<h3>Labs</h3>
												<p>
													Labs are also very important in training, since they are involved in most subjects. It is always an opportunity to put into practice 
													the theoretical knowledge acquired elsewhere. Labs are very numerous and always very rich, and are often approached in the final
													 year as mini-projects in their own right. 
												</p>
											</div>
											
											<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Agile/scrum</h3>
												<p>
													It seems important to me to highlight the fact of having a first experience of development in Agile/Scrum mode with the use 
													of Jira. This is a skill that is in great demand in the world of software development, and it allows me to justify my first experience with 
													this method. It's a particularly effective working method that I won't hesitate to use again. 
												</p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Research work</h3>
												<p>
													Research work is also an integral part of the training, and many papers and reports are requested in this respect. 
													Each research work allows students to learn how to choose and cite their sources, to produce a report in a given 
													time and most of the time in a limited number of pages. 
													It is also a work of synthesis, which in the end allows you to retain only the essence of your subject. 
												</p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Self training</h3>
												<p>
													Self-training is also recognised as an evaluation method, which makes it possible to give real value to personal projects developed elsewhere, 
													or projects carried out in previous years. This method makes it possible to promote and encourage work and personal development. 
												</p>
											</div>

									<h3><u>Strengths</u></h3>
									<ul>
										<li><strong>Expertise in Electronics for Embedded Sytems</strong>: 2 year specialization in Embedded Systems, covered system design, microcontroller programming, energy aspect, efficiency, security aspects. </li>
										<li><strong>Agility</strong>: Strong technical background in several disciplines</li>
										<li><strong>Strong knowledge in IoT standards</strong>: Experience with several IoT related technologies (OM2M, NodeRed,...)</li>
										<li><strong>Software development experience</strong>: Development in Middleware and Services with web interface</li>
										<li><strong>Project management experience</strong>: Courses related to team management, budgetting and experience with Innovative Project.</li>
									</ul>

									<h3><u>What should be improved...</u></h3>
									<p>After following the ISS training, I would say that I have a wide range of technical knowledge, with an expertise in Embedded Systems. As it is not possible to become a master in 
									every field after six months, I would say that I still have a lot to learn about software development and subjects related to Cloud Computing. As a matter of fact, I decided to 
									do my final year internship in software development (full-stack) and big data in order to have profesionnal experiences both in hardware and software. It is quite challenging, but I am confident
									about the fact that I will learn a lot during the next six months.
									</p>


									<h3><u>About portofolio assessment</u></h3>
									<p>At the end of this year, I feel that I would be able to design and implement a smart device from hardware development to high level software.
									I have the necessary skills to even identify the potential issues and take into account power consumption, security, scalability, mobility and display for a given
									application. I am also able now to select a technology based on a system's specifications. <br/>
									
									<br/>This year brought me a lot in terms of teamwork and people I could meet even if it was a bit special with the second lockdown. 
									Diversity in profiles makes te teamwork even more rich, and the exchanges more interesting. It feels good to be able to consider myself as 
									an expert in my domain now, with a wide technical background. It was rewarding to be able to help others in my field of expertise, to apply a reverse pedagogy, sometimes explaining electronic concepts.
									It was also rewarding to be able to learn from people with different backgrounds.  <br/>

									<br/>Finally, the portofolio assessment was the best way for me to showcase my skills and experience, while taking a step back from my training.
									Upgrading this portofolio through the semester and looking for the best possible way to present every experience, skill as well as training units
									was very instructive. The very construction of this website shows my investment in my training, and the writing of this portfolio has been beneficial to me in every way.
