												<h3>Internship</h3>
											</header>
											<strong>Environment and context</strong>
											<p>Thales Alenia Space designs and delivers
												satellites for telecommunications, the
												navigation, Earth observation and management
												environmental, exploration, science and technology, and
												orbital structures. This internship was carried out at
												LPE department, in the Radiation Test team.
												In space, the cosmic rays and the
												solar flares are carriers of heavy ions, heavy metals and
												protons and neutrons. When these particles
												collide with a microelectronic device
												(processor) of the satellite, that
												may cause a strong current surge
												due to a short circuit (called latchup) and therefore
												potentially cause the destruction of the component.
											</p>

											<strong>Assigned missions</strong>
											<p>My mission was to develop a PCB for a test bench in order to monitor latchup events 
												in components such as FPGA under radiations. Several parameters had to be taken into acccount:
												assembly, size, integration and easy to use. My achievements were the following: 
												<ul>
													<li>Realization of the
														system under CAD software
														electronic (length: 25 pages)</li>
													<li>Creation of a library of
														symbols to represent
														project-specific components
														PCB routing, ready to be
														launched in production after review
														(width: 10 layers)</li>
													<li>Creation of a bookshop
														of component cavities for
														link the representation of the diagram to the
														physical representation on the PCB.</li>

												<h3>Innovative Project</h3>
											</header>
											<strong>Environment and context</strong>
											<p>This project was carried out during the 5 months of the last INSA year. The goal of this project is to design an architecture for a flight simulator with VR headset and dynamic seat. 
												The idea is to build a simulator to show the know-how of INSA students (demonstration at the JPO, lab support, etc.). An internship has 
												already been carried out to create the software part of the flight simulator, and to link this 
												representation with the virtual reality headset. A proof of concept (POC) was made from this realization, which is functional.</p>
											<strong>Assigned missions</strong>
											<p>My missions concerned 2 major parts in this project: the controller part, and the communication one.
												More precisely, I had to:
												<ul>
													<li>Choose the controllers' architecture</li>
													<li>Assemble the 3D printed controllers</li>
													<li>Specify the communication protocol and header</li>
													<li>Implement the protocol in Unity</li>

											<strong>Environment and context</strong>
											<p>Chemical synthesis of WO3 nanoparticles and integration on
												microelectronic devices for the realisation of a gas sensor. 
												Evaluation of sensor performance under controlledatmosphere. </p>
											<strong>Assigned missions</strong>
											<p>The objective is to produce a gas sensor based on WO3 nanoparticles and then to evaluate it under the following conditions
												controlled gaseous atmosphere to provide the datasheet. The process then breaks down into 4
												milestones :
												<ul>
													<li>Synthesis of WO3 nanoparticles</li>
													<li>Development of the microchip</li>
													<li>Integration of the sensitive nanoparticle layer on the chip</li>
													<li>Electrical characterisation of the sensor under controlled atmosphere</li>
												</ul>
												The final gas sensor is to be integrated to become a "smart sensor". To do so, I had to design a PCB in KiCad in order to have
												on the same board the produced sensor, a commercial sensor as well as an Arduino Uno. A circuit analysis was conducted on LTSpice
												before the integration.

												<h3>Reasearch work on communication and protocols for connected objects</h3>
											</header>
											<strong>Environment and context</strong>
											<p>This research work was carried out within the framework of the UF 'Communication'. The first study was carried out about Bluetooth technology,
												which is a wireless networking protocol designed to quickly and
												remotely connect devices to computers or to each other. Bluetooth devices automatically detect and connect to each other, making
												communication much easier. Bluetooth Low Energy technology is a very low-power alternative for sensors and accessories.
												It is ideal for applications that do not require a continuous connection, but require a long life
												battery. </p>
												
											<p>The wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are used in a wide range of applications to capture, gather and analyze
												data from their environment. The wireless sensor network architecture typically consists of a large number
												of small battery-powered sensor nodes displayed over an area of interest and forming a multi-hop communication
												network. In a wireless sensor network sensors nodes are a low cost, resource constrained devices. Due to their location and possibly difficulty of access, energy efficiency is an important requirement in a
												medium access control (MAC) protocol for most wireless sensor networks. This was the object of the second study.</p>
											<strong>Assigned missions</strong>
											<p>The mission was to succeed in documenting the requested protocols from reliable sources and to synthesize the result in 
												the form of a report of a few pages. 
												The reports for both parties can be found just below. </p>

											<strong>Environment and context</strong>
											<p>In relation with communication, I also conducted a research project about the environmental impact
												of 5G.  </p>
											
											<strong>Assigned missions</strong>
											<p>The mission was to succeed in documenting the 5G development in terms of environmental impacts. 
												It was also a teamwork, so we divided the tasks. My mission was to present more specifically 
												about the impact of datacenters with the increase in data flow and the questions raised by 5G's introduction in France.

										<strong>Assigned missions</strong>
										<p>The first one took the form of a lab. In this lab we learned about virtualization techniques. These techniques are used in IT
											environments that support the provisioning (i.e. development, deployment, management) of
											novel software systems (with their potential constraints such as QoS and security). These
											environments are typically dynamic and distributed. In the practical part, my mission was to 
											use the VirtualBox hypervisor in NAT mode to connect a VM to the
											network in a first part. The bridge mode was used in the second part of the lab, with another
											hypervisor (OpenStack). </p>

										<p>The goal of this lab is to explore the capabilities of the MQTT protocol for IoT. To do that
											I made a little state of art about the main characteristics of MQTT, and I developped a
											simple application with an IoT device (ESP8266) using the MQTT protocol to communicate
											with a server on a laptop. In the second lab, I learned how to interact with the oneM2M RESTful architecture using

										<p>In this lab, I developed a Web application (Proof-of-Concept) for managing INSA’s rooms.  
											This application allows automatic closing windows, heating management, and lights management. This application relies on software services, sensors, and actuators. 
											The goal is to retrieve data from sensors and analyze them to enable taking decisions.Through software services (Restful Web services), the application retrieves data from sensors(temperature, presence, ...), 
											and according to the values of the retrieved data, actions on actuators can be triggered. We designed our application based on a Rest architecture, we implemented the different servicesand services calls as well 
											as a web interface for viewing the history of actions. 
											The language used is Java on the SpringBoot for Rest services framework. We used OM2M for sensors and actuators based architecture. </p>

											<h3>Introductory research project</h3>
										</header>
										<strong>Environment and context</strong>
										<p>Over the last decade, artificial intelligence has become an active field of research. Even though
											its use is growing exponentially, only few truly understand what is at stake.
											The definition of artificial intelligence as well as its challenges and the issues it raises are still very
											vague notions to be understood by most. As the effectiveness of non-scientific tools to spread scientific
											knowledge has been proved, our challenge is to popularize artificial intelligence and refute all
											prejudices around it in a playful way. The focus is mainly on students of middle and high school.
											Keeping that in mind, we designed an escape game on the theme of AI. An escape game is a
											game to be played in a group built around a succession of puzzles, most of the time to solve a
											situation or to escape a place.
											Since the idea of this project is to make the game accessible to all, the setup uses as few materials
											as possible, including objects you can easily have access to (smartphone, paper, blackboard, etc.).
											We decided to make a virtual version of the game, so that everyone can be able to play online. It
											is focused on a development suitable for schools and universities. All the puzzles composing the
											escape game revolve around a background story, with a problem to solve.</p>
										<strong>Assigned missions</strong>
										<p>To better understand what is at stake with Artificial Intelligence, we conducted a 6 months 
											research work about AI history, techniques and ethical questions it raises. 
											The report provides an overview of Artificial Intelligence and discusses definition and history, the
											main techniques of AI algorithms, as well as its current use in society. Possibilities and estimations
											on AI future developments are shared. Then, the project of developing an online escape game based
											on AI is presented. </p>

											<h3>Development in C++ language</h3>
										</header>
										<strong>Environment and context</strong>
										<p>In the context of development in C++ language for an INSA course, I developped a simulated
											chicken house with sensors such as luminosity, presence and ultrasonic sensors. </p>
										<strong>Assigned missions</strong>
										<p>My mission was first to define the project: which sensors are we going to need to monitor a whole chicken house.
											Tehn, I also had to work a bit on the simulation: we did not build the chicken house, but we simulated its environment
											through variables set to change randomly (outside luminosity, chicken eating and drinking,...). I truly think 
											this project can be linked to the ISS training, because it was the first time I could (virtualy) develop a sensor network. 
											It is interesting to see how we can use a unique sensor for several applications depending on the retrieved data. I produced a report 
											which can be foud below.  </p>
